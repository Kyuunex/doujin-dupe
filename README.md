# Meteor Addon Template

An automation to the 1.20.5+ Book dupe. Patched in Paper 1.21.1 build 36.  

Thanks to Kurine for finding this dupe!

### How to use

- Place Book and Quill in your offhand
- Place everything you wanna dupe in your inventory (and optionally Ender Chest)
- Relog to force save your player data
- Open the module settings and configure everything to your liking. Bind it to a hotkey.
- Turn on Auto-reconnect, set it to where you dont get throttled
- Turn on the module, and let it dupe
